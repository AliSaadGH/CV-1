                <p>Joel, a grizzled survivor of a dangerous post pandemic world, who has slowly lost his sense of morality after the loss of his daughter, and Ellie, a young girl with her own struggle to find real human connection, are forced together and must travel across the U.S. in search of a feint hope for the future of humanity.</p>

                <h1  id="Joel">Joel</h1>
                <p>Joel serves as the main protagonist and is tasked with escorting the young Ellie across a post-apocalyptic United States in an attempt to create a potential cure for an infection to which Ellie is immune.</p>
                <p>He is a single parent, that is depicted as sensitive and emotionally engaged with his daughter. After her death and the 20 years that follow, in which Joel witnessed more horrific events, he has significantly changed, using violence to solve issues and showing reluctance when asked to escort Ellie.</p>

                <h1  id="Ellie">Ellie</h1>
                <p>Ellie is described as "mature beyond her years" as a result of the circumstances of her environment. She is characterized as strong, witty, and "a little rough around the edges". Her emotional trauma is accentuated after her encounter with Joel. Having lost many people in her life, she suffers from severe monophobia and survivor's guilt. This results in her becoming a very hardened person; she uses violence without hesitation and frequently employs profane language.</p>
